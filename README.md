Glaucoma is a leading reason for blindness and needs to be monitored and prevented. cup to disc ratio (CDR) is the important indicator of the glaucoma. The normal CDR is less than 0.6. However sometimes, this cutoff does not hold for glaucoma. Some patients with normal eye have higher than 0.6 CDR and vice versa. Hence we need to normalize the CDR.
